2007-07-08 patrick  Debug-enabled code linked against the release runtime on
                    Windows is now named the same as optimized code. The debug
                    DLLs are installed in the "debug" subdirectory.
                    vpr::LibraryLoader no longer looks for plug-ins with the
                    "_g" name variation by default.

                    vpr::SocketStream, vpr::SocketDatagram, and
                    vpr::SerialPort) to return the result "out the back"
