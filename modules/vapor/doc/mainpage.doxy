/*! \mainpage VPR - The VR Juggler Portable Runtime

The VR Juggler Portable Runtime (VPR) is the foundation for all software
in the Juggler Project.  It provides an object-oriented operating system
abstraction layer upon which cross-platform software can be written.  It
abstracts sockets, threads, synchronization primitves, and serial I/O.
