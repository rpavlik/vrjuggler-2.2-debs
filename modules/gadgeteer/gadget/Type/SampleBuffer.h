 *
 * Buffer class for input data.
 *
 * The SampleBuffer stores the readings from an input device.
 *
 * It consists of two buffers (vectors of vectors of samples) that hold.
 * The "stable" samples and the "ready" samples.
 *
 * Stable - Samples that the application is actually looking at.
 * Ready  - Samples that have been completed and could be swapped over to
 *          current.
 *
 * ASSERTION: The buffers can be empty at the start, but after the first cycle
 *            (first time stable gets values) the Stable buffer must have at
 *            least one sample.
 *
 * @param MAX_BUFFER_SIZE The maximum allowable size of the buffer.  After it
 *                        gets this large we will start throwing away old data.
