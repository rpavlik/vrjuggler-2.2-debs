/**
 * Position derived class for running a Flock of Birds.
 * Also a wrapper class for the real Ascension Flock class "FlockStandalone".
 *
 * Flock adds to the FlockStandalone class shared memory and threading.
 * Flock is a positional device driver for the Flock of Birds, the config
 * element in the constructor should set up all the settings, for these to be
 * changed the Flock has to be deleted and a new instance created with an
 * updated config element.
 *
 * @note Some functions still remain for changing the options of
 *       the Flock when its not in Sampling mode, but in order to stay
 *       consistent with the gadget::Position functionality these
 *       are only left for building apps without jccl::ConfigElement objects.
 * @note A note on reciever access:
 *       Clients of juggler should access tracker recievers as [0-n]
 *       For example, if you have recievers 1,2, and 4 with transmitter on 3,
 *       then you can access the data, in order, as 0,1,2.
