/**
 *  Position-derived class for running an Ascension MotionStar device that
 *  is connected to a Flock of Birds.  It is a wrapper class for the real
 *  driver class 'MotionStarStandalone'.
 *
 *  MotionStar adds to the MotionStarStandalone class shared memory and
 *  threading.<br>
 *  MotionStar is a positional device driver for the Flock of Birds.  The
 *  config element in the constructor should set up all the settings.  For
 *  these to be changed, the MotionStar has to be deleted and a new instance
 *  created with an updated config element.
 *  <br>
 *
 * @note Some functions still remain for changing the options of the
 *        MotionStar when its not in Sampling mode, but in order to stay
 *        consistent with the gadget::Position functionality these are only
 *        left for building apps without jccl::ConfigElement objects.
 * @note A note on reciever access:
 *   Clients of Juggler should access tracker recievers as [0-n].  For
 *   example, if you have recievers 1,2, and 4 with transmitter on 3, then
 *   you can access the data, in order, as 0, 1, 2.
