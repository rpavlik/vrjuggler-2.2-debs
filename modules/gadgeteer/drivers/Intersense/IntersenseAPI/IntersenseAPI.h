/**
 * Position derived class for running an IS900 tracking system.
 *
 * Wraps the IntersenseStandalone driver.
 *
 * Intersense is a positional device driver for the Flock of Birds, the config
 * element in the constructor should set up all the settings, for these to be
 * changed the Flock has to be deleted and a new instance created with an
 * updated config element.
 *
 * @note Intersense inherits from Digital and Analog.  These base classes,
 *       however, can not handle multiple receivers in the same way as
 *       gadget::Position.  Therefore, to access buttons 0-3 on station 0,
 *       call for button 0-3. but to access buttons 0-3 on station 1,
 *       you must ask for units 4-7, and so on.
 * @note Some functions still remain for changing the options of
 *       the flock when its not in Sampling mode, but in order to stay
 *       consistent with the gadget::Position functionality these
 *       are only left for building apps without jccl::ConfigElement objects.
 * @note A note on receiver access:
 *   Clients of juggler should access tracker recievers as [0-n]
 *   For example, if you have recievers 1,2, and 4 with transmitter on 3,
 *   then you can access the data, in order, as 0,1,2.
