 * Implementation of <code>TweekBean</code> that is for Service Beans.  A

 * Environment Service and the Global Preferences Service.  Both of these
 * Beans are accessed indirectly through proxy types.  This approach hides
 * the details of looking up the Service Bean in the Bean Registry while
 * still giving access to the full Service Bean interface.
