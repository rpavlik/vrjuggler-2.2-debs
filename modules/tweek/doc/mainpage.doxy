/*! \mainpage Tweek

Tweek is a collection of multiple technologies: C++, Java, JavaBeans,
and CORBA. Combined, these allow a Java GUI composed of plug-ins to
communicate with a C++ application. Our implementation aims to simplify
the inter-language communication so that programmers can make use of
Tweek in their VR applications without knowing all the details of the
individual technologies.
