/**
 * Describes collection of WizardPanes in a particular sequence with the
 * expectation that the user will walk through them from beginning to end. A
 * particular wizard can be serialized at design time and brought back to life
 * when the user requests it.
 * <p>
 * A wizard contains a sequence of wizard steps which are processed linearly.
 * Any of these steps may be another sequence of wizard steps that offshoot from
 * the root sequence.
 * <p>
 * While to the user a wizard appears to be a linear iteration through wizard
 * panes, a wizard is really stored as a tree. Since the choice of what wizard
 * pane to show next could rely on choices the user made in the previous pane,
 * it seems logical that a wizard should be implemented as a tree of wizard
 * panes connected by the logic conditions that decide which pane to show next.
