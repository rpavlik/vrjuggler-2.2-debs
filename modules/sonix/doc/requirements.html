sonix (high level, easy to use, audio abstraction for vr/games)
-----------------
subsystem abstraction for audio hardware or audio APIs, reconfigurable
allowing audio APIs to be safely swapped out at runtime without the
dependant systems noticing.  systems using this layer expect to be
completely portable.  changing sound APIs at run time will be useful so
that the user can play with quality and latency differences of different
hardware and different soud APIs

requirement specification:
- an application should be able to change APIs or hardware device API is using
  without the resource handles having to be reset manually.
- Changing a resource through its resource handle should reflect properly
  in all other handles to that same resource (rsrc will have multiple users)
- support basic operations common to simple vr and game applications
  - load file
  - play
  - stop
  - pause
  - set position
  - maybe pitch?

(how it is implemented now)
- implemented directly on top of openal and audioworks.
- very high level and easy to use.
- eventually this high level thing could/should be moved on top of subsynth
- designed to be very simple, not the end-all be-all audio system
  very good at simply playing 3D sounds without any hassle to the user.
- sounds are accessed by std::string handles, if invalid string is used,
  then system does nothing - no assert, no dump, just silence.
- C style monolithic singleton class that hides all the resource management.
  - pass a string into each func to designate what resource user is acting on.
- currently provides convenience functions for playing prebuffered sound files
- supports OpenAL (OAL) and AudioWorks (AW)
- needs to support file formats other than aif (AW), and wav (OAL)
- needs an API for streaming data, required for the synth.
