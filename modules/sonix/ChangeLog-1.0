Dec-23-2004 patrickh    NEW VERSION: 0.91.0
Nov-18-2004 patrickh    Moved the sonix class into the snx namespace.  Renamed
                        the namespaces snxEndian and snxFileIO to snx::Endian
                        and snx::FileIO.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.5.0
Nov-17-2004 patrickh    Fixed potential problems with polymorphic Sonix types
                        not being compiled into the sonix library correctly.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.4.1
Apr-11-2004 patrickh    Sonix now depends on an installed version of GMTL.
Dec-01-2003 patrickh    Removed the deletePlugin() function from the required
                        list of entry points a Sonix plug-in must implement.
                        Now, snx::ISoundImplementation defines a pure virtual
                        destroy() method that must be implemented.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.3.0
Nov-29-2003 chooze      Removed XDL in favor of using vpr::Library.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.3.0
Nov-27-2003 patrickh    Moved the plug-in code from snx/plugins into plugins
                        and gave the plug-ins their own build system.
Nov-27-2003 patrickh    Rewrote the build system.
Jul-24-2003 browner     Added the audiere plugin.  this required the
                        modification of the SoundInfo struct for a streaming
                        flag - which means we now support streaming apis
                        NEW VERSION: 0.2.2
Oct-25-2002 patrickh    Replaced use of snx::Singleton<T> with the thread-safe
                        vpr::Singleton<T>.  The header snx/Singleton.h has
                        been removed from the source tree.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.2.1
Oct-14-2002 browner     Modified Sonix to use VPR for output.  And updated the
                        build system accordingly.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.2.0
Sep-13-2002 patrickh    Fixed a nasty segmentation fault, most likely caused
                        by a stack overrrun.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.1.2
Sep-04-2002 nonchocoboy AudioWorks plugin now actually works.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.1.1
Aug-29-2002 nonchocoboy Changed the build so that the sonix implementations are
                        built as individual shared libraries ready to be loaded
                        dynamically at runtime via the plugin system that was
                        built into sonix earlier. Sonix now only scans the
                        following directories for plugins:
                              ${SNX_BASE_DIR}/share/sonix/plugins
                              ${HOME}/.sonix/plugins
                        NEW VERSION: 0.1.0
Aug-06-2002 patrickh    Developer installations are now constructed using the
                        standard installation targets.
Aug-06-2002 subatomic   Added plugin for Subsynth audio synthesizer.
Aug-04-2002 subatomic   Use abstract interface class ISoundImplementation
                        so that plugins can be loaded at runtime instead of
                        compiled statically.
Aug-03-2002 subatomic   Added subsynth plugin.
Aug-01-2002 patrickh    Enabled compiling of profiled libraries.
Jul-30-2002 patrickh    Fixed problems with building on IRIX wherein the Sonix
                        library was not put into lib{32,64} correctly.
Jul-20-2002 subatomic   Added plugin loading support with xdl (cross platform
                        dlopen).  There currently are no plugins that work with
                        this, stay tuned...  Sonix will scan 3 directories for
                        plugins: "${SNX_BASE_DIR}/lib/modules/sonix"
                                 "${SNX_BASE_DIR}/share/sonix/plugins"
                                 "${HOME}/.sonix/plugins"
Jun-24-2002 patrickh    The sonix-config script is now written in Perl.  It is
                        capable of determining its installation path at
                        runtime.
Apr-16-2002 subatomic   Added grouping in doxygen autodocumentation
Apr-12-2002 subatomic   pause, unpause, set volume, pitch, and retriggerable
Apr-12-2002 subatomic   Added isPaused, isRetriggerable, isPlaying
Apr-12-2002 subatomic   Sonix uses GMTL for math.  Vapor dependency is removed.
Dec-28-2001 subatomic   SoundHandle is now available.  Use it to allocate and
                        access sound objects.
Oct-24-2001 subatomic   Sonix uses juggler math and vapor singleton now.
                        NOTE, because of this change you'll need to link
                        against VR Juggler, JCCL, Gadgeteer, and VPR libs.
                        Once Juggler math is separated, these dependancies
                        will drastically reduce.
Oct-22-2001 subatomic   renamed project to sonix
Jun-21-2001 subatomic   Newest Juggler Audio is born.  Based on my previous two
                        revisions, I've refactored the vjSoundManager into two
                        parts.  One part (core) that can stand alone as a
                        useful reconfigurable sound adapter, and one part that
                        allows VR Juggler to communicate with the core.  This
                        newest derivitive of the VR Juggler sound manager
                        finally allows runtime reconfiguration of the sounds
                        and their respective sound implementations.  Also it
                        allows extension of available sound drivers at runtime
                        to help facilitate an always running system.  This
                        iteration of the VR Juggler sound code will be called
                        AudioJuggler.
Dec-05-2000 subatomic   Rewrote vjSoundManager to allow run-time
                        reconfiguration like all the other components of VR
                        Juggler.  This code is a prototype, and is not yet
                        good enough to go into the main distribution of VR
                        Juggler.
Jun-17-2000 subatomic   Created the VR Juggler vjSoundManager and associated
                        classes which allow a VR juggler application to
                        generically use sound within an application.
                        vjSoundManager is essentially an adaptor to an
                        underlying sound API, in this case SL library, or
                        Audioworks.
