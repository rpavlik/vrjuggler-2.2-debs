Things to do in sonix

Fix Bugs:
- respect whether a sound is retriggerable
- fix reconfiguration (startup/shutdown/startup) of AudioWorks
  - currently fails
- fix reconfiguration (startup/shutdown/startup) of OpenAL
  - succeeds, but sounds cannot play after this (mysterious)
  - NOTE: last i checked this doesn't happen anymore, so maybe openal
    has been fixed since last I tried this...


Add Features:
- fill in the implementaion that allows the soundAPI state to be configured
  - make sure this state is transferred when an API is changed to another.
- support for streaming audio
- DSP plugins (maybe?) streaming audio might work with this.
