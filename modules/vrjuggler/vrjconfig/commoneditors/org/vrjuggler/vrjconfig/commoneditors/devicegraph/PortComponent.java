/**
 * This class is an attempt to work around the difficulty of figuring out where
 * to place a port within a vertex that uses a custom renderer.  A vertex
 * renderer using this class can add instances of this class to its layout,
 * and the ports will have their location (offset in JGraph parlance) set based
 * on the location of the component's instance within the layout.  Hence,
 * layout changes cause the ports to be relocated.
 *
 * This class is a colossal hack; it is an abomination.  It exists for two
 * reasons:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>
 *     I could not figure out how to set port locations the way I wanted in
 *     the custom renderers.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     I could not make sense enough of how to use JGraph's port renderers
 *     to implement the capabilities I wanted using their system.
 *   </li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * This works, and it works behind the scenes.  It is, nonetheless, a hack.
