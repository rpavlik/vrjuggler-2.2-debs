   <h2>MotionStar Wireless&reg; configuration steps:</h2>
      
      <h3><u><b>Hardware Settings</b></u></h3>
      
      <h4>Server Address</h4>
      Set server address (IP address or host name).  If the value entered
      is not a valid host name or IP address, it will be displayed in
      <font color="#ff0000">red</font> text.  This does not necessarily
      indicate an error.  Rather, it is simply an indication that an error
      might occur when the VR Juggler application is run.

      <h4>Server Network Port</h4>
      Set server listening port (TCP&nbsp;=&nbsp;6000,
      UDP&nbsp;=&nbsp;5000).  TCP is generally the best option.

      <h4>Is Master?</h4>
      Indicate whether the named chassis is a master or a slave.  The
      chassis will only be a slave when multiple packs are used.  In that
      case, there will be one master chassis and one or more slaves.

      <h4>Hemisphere</h4>
      Set the hemisphere of the transmitter within which the user(s) will
      be operating. The Front hemisphere is located on the side of the
      Ascension logo.

      <h4>Data Format</h4>
      Set the data format to be used by the sensors.  Currently,
      <i>only</i> the format <b>Position and Angles</b> is known to work
      reliably.

      <h4>Sampling Mode</h4>
      Choose the sample mode.  Using <b>Run Continuous</b> will be the
      most efficient because the driver will not have to make repeated
      requests for samples, thereby saving bandwidth and computation
      cycles on the MotionStar chassis and on the machine where the
      Gadgeteer driver is running.
 
      <h4>Sensor Report Rate</h4>
      Set the report rate for the sensors.  This determines how frequently
      the sensors send data to the MotionStar chassis.  A value of 1
      indicates that they should send data every cycle.  A value of 2
      indicates that they should send data every other cycle, and so on.
 
      <h4>Chassis Mesaurement Rate</h4>
      Set the measurement rate for the chassis.  This value depends on
      the configuration of the hardware.  The factory default is 86.1.
      An invalid value will have a negative impact on the quality of the
      tracking data.

      <h4>Device Host</h4>
      <i>CLUSTER ONLY</i>: Set the cluster node where the MotionStar
      Wireless&reg; device driver will be run.

      <h3><u><b>Transmitter Settings</b></u></h3>

      <p>
      Under the <b>Transmitter</b>, you will find the settings for the
      placement of the MotionStar Wireless&reg; transmitter (the big,
      heavy black box).  The orientation and position of the transmitter
      are configured relative to the VR Juggler coordinate frame.  Remember
      that the transmitter coordinate frame has positive X coming out of
      the front (the face with the Ascension logo) and positive Y to the
      left.  Refer to Page 132 of the <i>MotionStar Wireless&reg;
      Installation and Operation Guide</i> (910006-A Rev C, published
      May 23, 2001).
      </p>

      <p>
      Configure the position and orientation of the MotionStar
      Wireless&reg; transmitter (the large black box) relative to the
      VR Juggler coordinate frame.  This process configures what is known
      as a "position transform filter."  The panels titled "Orientation"
      and "Position" present an easy way to perform this task.
      </p>
   
      <h4>Orientation</h4>
      First, choose the coordinate frame rotation from the
      <b>Transmitter Coordinate Frame</b> list.  To enter the X, Y, and
      Z rotation values directly, click the <b>Manual Entry</b> button
      and fill in the values to the right of the list.


      <h4>Position</h4>
      Next, set the position of the transmitter relative to the
      chosen VR Juggler origin.  The units can be entered as
      meters, centimeters, feet, or inches.  Make sure to pick the
      units before entering the location value.


      <h4>Tracker Units</h4>
      Set the physical units of the data returned by the sensors.
      Currently, the MotionStar Wireless&reg; tracking system
      <i>only</i> returns data in <b>Inches</b>.
