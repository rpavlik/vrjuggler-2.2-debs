   <ol>
      <li>
         Set server address (IP address or host name).  If the value entered
         is not a valid host name or IP address, it will be displayed in
         <font color="#ff0000">red</font> text.  This does not necessarily
         indicate an error&mdash;it is simply an indication that an error
         might occur when the VR Juggler application is run.
      </li>
      <li>
         Set server listening port (TCP&nbsp;=&nbsp;6000,
         UDP&nbsp;=&nbsp;5000).  TCP is generally the best option.
      </li>
      <li>
         Indicate whether the named chassis is a master or a slave.  The
         chassis will only be a slave when multiple packs are used.  In that
         case, there will be one master chassis and one or more slaves.
      </li>
      <li>
         Set the hemisphere of the transmitter within which the user(s) will
         be operating.
      </li>
      <li>
         Set the data format to be used by the sensors.  Currently,
         <i>only</i> the format <b>Position and Angles</b> is known to work
         reliably.
      </li>
      <li>
         Choose the sample mode.  Using <b>Run Continuous</b> will be the
         most efficient because the driver will not have to make repeated
         requests for samples, thereby saving bandwidth and computation
         cycles on the MotionStar chassis and on the machine where the
         Gadgeteer driver is running.
      </li>
      <li>
         Set the report rate for the sensors.  This determines how frequently
         the sensors send data to the MotionStar chassis.  A value of 1
         indicates that they should send data every cycle.  A value of 2
         indicates that they should send data every other cycle, and so on.
      </li>
      <li>
         Set the measurement rate for the chassis.  This value depends on
         the configuration of the hardware.  The factory default is 86.1.
         An invalid value will have a negative impact on the quality of the
         tracking data.
      </li>
      <li>
         Set the physical units of the data returned by the sensors.
         Currently, the MotionStar Wireless tracking system <i>only</i>
         returns data in <b>Inches</b>.
      </li>
      <li>
         Configure the position and orientation of the MotionStar Wireless
         transmitter (the large black box) relative to the VR Juggler
         coordinate frame.  This process configures what is known as a
         "position transform filter."  The panels titled "Orientation" and
         "Position" present an easy way to perform this task.

         <p>
            Configuring the position filter involves ...
