VR Juggler Audio System --> (Sonix)

NOTE: see the Sonix directory for more information and a
more complete README including description and APIs supported.



VR Juggler audio system is implemented with a module called Sonix.

If you need to add an API or fix something you do it in the Sonix
module.  VR Juggler depends on Sonix, but not the other way.

The code in this directory is simply some "glue" to make Sonix work
better with VR Juggler.  You don't need to compile VR juggler with this
glue, but without it you will need to configure AJ completely yourself as
well as call update yourself.

This "glue" allows VR Juggler to sync, update, and configure Sonix
through the VR juggler Kernel and config chunks, allowing audio to
seemingly be controlled by VR juggler.
