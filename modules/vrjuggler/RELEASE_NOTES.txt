                           VR Juggler Release Notes
                           ------------------------

For all versions:

    - See the ChangeLog for more system-level changes that do not directly
      affect applications.
    - See the Known Bugs page on the VR Juggler website (www.vrjuggler.org)
      for the current list of bugs.

===============================================================================

 Version: 2.2.0 Beta 1
Released: July 9, 2007

    Please refer to the following to get started with VR Juggler 2.2.0:

       http://developer.vrjuggler.org/wiki/MigratingToVrjTwoTwo

    In general, there are no required application changes to update from
    VR Juggler 2.0 to VR Juggler 2.2. However, applications making direct
    use of VPR (the VR Juggler Portable Runtime) classes including
    vpr::SerializableObject must be updated for API changes in VPR 2.0.

    VR Juggler 2.0 configurations must be loaded into VRJConfig in order
    to be updated automatically. Before doing that, however, it is highly
    recommended that all VR Juggler 2.0 configuration files be processed
    using an XSLT processor and the stylesheet
    modules/vrjuggler/data/xslt/key_sym_2_0.xsl. More information about this
    can be found on the above referenced web page.

 Version: 2.1.9
Released: June 19, 2006

    Required application and configuration changes for upgrading from
    releases prior to 2.0.2 and 2.1.9:

        * Subclasses of vrj::OsgApp that override latePreFrame() must call
          up to vrj::OsgApp::latePreFrame() as the last step of the override
          implementation.
