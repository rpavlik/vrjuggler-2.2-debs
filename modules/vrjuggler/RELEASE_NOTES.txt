===============================================================================

 Version: 2.2.0
Released: August 14, 2007

    Please refer to the following to get started with VR Juggler 2.2.0:

       http://developer.vrjuggler.org/wiki/MigratingToVrjTwoTwo

    In general, there are no required application changes to update from
    VR Juggler 2.0 to VR Juggler 2.2. However, applications making direct
    use of VPR (the VR Juggler Portable Runtime) classes including
    vpr::SerializableObject must be updated for API changes in VPR 2.0.

    VR Juggler 2.0 configurations must be loaded into VRJConfig in order
    to be updated automatically. Before doing that, however, it is highly
    recommended that all VR Juggler 2.0 configuration files be processed
    using an XSLT processor and the stylesheet
    modules/vrjuggler/data/xslt/key_sym_2_0.xsl. More information about this
    can be found on the above referenced web page.

    New in this release:
       * Improved cluster scalability and performance.

       * Improved error handling and recovery through the use of exceptions
         for error reporting. VR Juggler 2.2 is based on VPR 2.0 which uses
         exception handling for all error reporting. vpr::ReturnStatus is now
         considered deprecated.

       * Easier command-line application build support by leveraging
         Flagpoll (see https://realityforge.vrsource.org/view/FlagPoll/WebHome
         for more information). This includes support for the use of Flagpoll
         on Windows by using Flagpoll 0.9.1 or enwer. Note that the *-config
         Perl scripts (such as vrjuggler-config) no longer exist in VR Juggler
         2.2. Forward compatibility for this change was introduced with VR
         Juggler 2.0.2.

       * Cocoa support on Mac OS X. VR Juggler applications are deployed as
         bundles, and X11 is not required at all. Mac OS X users should review
         the updated VR Juggler /Getting Started Guide/ for information on
         application execution options.

       * Support for parallel installations. To facilitate long-lived
         applications, the Juggler runtime (shared libraries and data files)
         from multiple versions can be installed in parallel. To get the most
         from this capability, users are strongly encouraged to use GMTL 0.5.4
         and CppDOM 0.7.9 or newer, both of which also support parallel
         installations.

       * Versioned headers, data files, and shared libraries on non-Windows
         platforms. This is all in support of parallel installations.

       * Versioned DLLs on Windows. Windows builds should use automatic
         linking to avoid complicated detection of .lib file names. Forward
         compatibility for this change (i.e., automatic linking) was
         introduced in VR Juggler 2.0.2.

       * Support for 64-bit applications on Windows. This requires the use of
         the CVS HEAD version of NSPR (currently known as NSPR 4.7).

       * Reduced dependency on NSPR on Windows. We are using Windows threading
         and synchronization primitives directly instead of the NSPR wrappers.

       * Reduced run-time dependence on environment variables such as
         VJ_BASE_DIR and SNX_BASE_DIR. This has been in the works since the
         VR Juggler 2.0 beta stages. Now, for the Windows case, running
         VR Juggler applications does not require setting VJ_BASE_DIR at all.
         The installation path is determined at run time when the DLLs are
         attached to the process. The Visual C++ project files still reference
         VJ_BASE_DIR and VJ_DEPS_DIR, however.

       * Support for OpenSG 2.0 in vrj::OpenSGApp.

       * Early support for Direct3D. The VR Juggler Direct3D Draw Manager is
         in the alpha stages of development, and feedback and improvements
         would be welcome.

       * Proper destruction of singletons created using the VPR singleton
         preprocessor macros when the application exits. This facilitates much
         cleaner shutdown, especially in the case of device drivers.

       * More flexible debug handling on Windows. There are now two
         debug-enabled versions of all binaries: one linked against the
         release runtime and one linked against the debug runtime. This allows
         applications linked against the release runtime to switch to using
         debug-enabled Juggler libraries simply by changing the PATH
         environment variable. This same capability has always existed on
         non-Windows platforms by modifying (DY)LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

       * Expanded use of boost::shared_ptr<> for better (internal) memory
         handling. User-level code will probably not see much of this.

       * Fixed stability problems with OSG applications when run with a
         multi-pipe/multi-threaded VR Juggler configuration.

       * Eliminated the need for OSG- and OpenSG-based applications to define
         plain OpenGL lighting just to make the VR Juggler simulator
         components render well. See the OSG and OpenSG sample applications
         for the current state of things.

       * Initial Unicode support for Gadgeteer keyboard/mouse devices.

       * Support for the noDNA X-IST device. Submitted by Damien Touraine.

       * Support for the USB Essential Reality P5 Glove. Submitted by Damian
         Touraine.

       * Revamped Polhemus Fastrak driver that is much easier to configure.

       * Enhanced configurability of multisampling with OpenGL windows.
         Currently, this is only supported fully on the X Window System.
