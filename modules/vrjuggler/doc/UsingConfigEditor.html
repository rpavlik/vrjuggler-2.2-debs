Using the VRLib Configuration System</H2>
This document describes the fundamentals of VRLib's extensible configuration
system, and gives an introduction to CfgEdit, a graphical configuration
editing utility written in Java.

Configuration Fundamentals - Smooth and Extra Chunky</H3>
VRLib has a <I>lot</I> of configuration information; enough that a simple
text-based configuration file would be an unmanageable mess. Things are
a lot simpler if we can divide things into manageable pieces.

<P>We call these pieces <I>ConfigChunks</I>, or <I>Chunks</I> for short.
A Chunk contains the configuration information for a particular component
of the system. For example, each supported input device will have a Chunk
describing its setup. Another kind of Chunk describes a display device.
There are many different kinds of Chunks, which store many different kinds
of information.

<P>To give you a better idea, here's a list of a few of the Chunks we used
in a development version of the library:
<UL>
<LI>
Display - defines a display window</LI>

<LI>
DisplaySystem - matches graphic pipes to X Displays</LI>

<LI>
IBox</LI>

<LI>
Flock - setup for an Ascension Flock of Birds</LI>

<LI>
Keyboard - stores key bindings for a keyboard-based input simulator</LI>

<LI>
DummyPosition - stores default orientation and position for a dummy tracker
standin.</LI>
</UL>
Each ConfigChunk contains one or more <I>Properties</I>. A Property has
a name, a type, and zero or more values. As an example, let's consider
a ConfigChunk for a 3-D tracking device with a serial interface. We might
choose these four properties:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Name</B> - a string value that provides a descriptive name for this
device. <I>All</I> ConfigChunks have a Name property. They are especially
useful for telling apart several ConfigChunks of the same type - like three
displays named "north", "south", and "middle".</LI>

<LI>
<B>Serial Port</B> - the serial port to connect to. If we're using some
kind of Unix system, this would be a single string value, "/dev/ttyd2"
or something similar.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Serial Speed</B> - the speed of the serial connection; probably a single
integer value.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Position Offset</B> - this might be an offset from the physical tracker
origin to some logical origin of your choice. We probably want a floating
point value for this property, but unlike our other examples, we want three
of them, for x, y, and z offsets. Any property can have multiple values,
but they must all be of the same type.</LI>
</UL>

<H4>
Property Details</H4>
Before we continue, let's take a closer look at the individual parts of
a Property.
<UL>
<H4>
Name</H4>
The name of a property is simply a text string used to refer to it by the
GUI, like "Serial Port" or "X Display Name".
<H4>
Token</H4>
The token is a lot like the name, and they are often the same string. The
difference is that the token is used internally, in the config file format,
and in the library itself when querying the configuration database. The
token is restricted in a way similar to C/C++ variable names: no whitespace
is permitted, and it may not begin with a number.
<H4>
Type</H4>
There are four primitive types for properties: strings, integers, floating-point
numbers, and booleans. In addition to these four types, Property values
can also refer to other ConfigChunks. Example: The ConfigChunk for "general
setup" might have a Property that lists the active Displays. The type for
this Property could just be a string (matching the name of a Display ConfigChunk),
but we can also make the Property type be "name of a Display ConfigChunk".
This lets the GUI be a little smarter and easier to use when editing that
property - but more on that later.
<H4>
Number</H4>
Most Properties have single values. Other times, as with our "Position
Offset" example, a Property may need a fixed number of values. It is also
possible for a Property to have a variable number of values; the list of
active Displays mentioned above would be a good example. There may be no
active displays, there may be 6, or 2, or just 1.
<H4>
Value Lists (optional)</H4>
Sometimes a Property might have a certain number of appropriate choices.
For example, the handedness of a glove is either "Left" or "Right", and
it would be nice if our GUI could display those as choices to the user,
instead of requiring them to type in a string. The configuration system
supports this with enumerations, which are simply lists of the appropriate
values for a Property. Enumerations for string Properties are just lists
of string values, while enumerations for integer and float Properties map
descriptive strings to numeric values.</UL>

<H3>
Configuration Files</H3>
The configuration information for a VRLib application is stored in several
files:
<UL>
<LI>
The <I>Global</I> config file contains a basic configuration. The global
file should be enough to get an application running; it should contain
all of the basic hardware setup information.</LI>

<LI>
The <I>User</I> config files are used to modify and add to a basic configuration.</LI>


<P>A user's config files are stored in the <TT>.C2Config</TT> directory
of the user's home directory. A user can have as many different User config
files as he or she desires. There may be different User config files for
different applications, or maybe one that sets up a particular set of simulator
devices.</UL>
When a VRLib application is initialized, it creates an internal database
of config information. The ConfigChunks defined in the Global config file
are added into the database, followed by the Chunks in a specified User
config file (<TT>~/.C2Config/default</TT> if none is specified). If a Chunk
in the User file has the same name as a Chunk in the Global file, it replaces
the previously-read Global Chunk.

<P>
<HR>
<H4>
ConfigChunk Descriptions</H4>
The configuration system is itself configurable. A separate file lists
all the available kinds of ConfigChunks, what their Properties are, wether
these Properties have enumerations, and so on. These <I>ChunkDescs</I>
can also be edited by the GUI.

<P>Because the ConfigChunk descriptions can be edited by users and developers,
applications built on VRLib can use this configuration system to handle
their own setup information. All that is needed is to add an "ApplicationData"
ChunkDesc with the appropriate Properties, and put a Chunk of that type
in one of the configuration files. This can all be done through the GUI.
VRLib provides an interface for the client application itself to access
this data.

The CfgEdit tool</H3>

<H4>
Installing CfgEdit</H4>

<OL>
<LI>
Make sure you have installed on your system the Java Development Kit (JDK),
version 1.1.3 or higher. <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/">Sun's
JDK index page</A> has information about obtaining the JDK for various
operating systems.</LI>

<LI>
Make a directory for the CfgEdit files. For demonstration purposes, we'll
use the directory <TT>/bin/cfgedit</TT>.</LI>

<LI>
Copy the following files into the directory you just made:</LI>

<PRE>CfgEdit
c2cfg.html
c2cfg.jar</PRE>

<LI>
CfgEdit is a very short script file that can be used to execute the CfgEdit
tool from any directory. However, it needs to be told how to find the .jar
file which contains the actual java code. To do this, find this line in
the file:</LI>

<PRE>java -classpath /bin/cfgedit/c2cfg.jar:$JDK_HOME/lib/classes.zip AppCore</PRE>
Change the path to c2cfg.jar to whatever directory you moved the files
to in step 2.
<LI>
Before running CfgEdit for the first time, create a directory called <TT>.C2Config</TT>
in your home directory. This will be used to store your User config files.</LI>

<LI>
Inside the <TT>.C2Config</TT> directory, create a file called <TT>basedir</TT>.
This file should contain one line: the name of the directory where the
Global config and ChunkDesc files are located. (This depends on where you
installed the rest of VRLib).</LI>
</OL>

<H4>
Running CfgEdit</H4>
Once installed, CfgEdit can be executed either as an application or as
an applet.

<P>To run as an application, simply run the CfgEdit script. The script
accepts the name of a User ConfigChunk file as an argument.

<P>To run as an applet, type <TT>appletviewer /bin/cfgedit/c2cfg.html</TT>
(or whatever the correct path to the html file is). While it is currently
easiest to run CfgEdit as an application, using the script, we hope to
soon be able to run the applet from various web browsers.

<P>As soon at it begins, CfgEdit checks the user's .C2Config/basedir file
to determine where the global configuration files are. It then loads files
in this order:
<OL>
<LI>
The Global ChunkDesc file, chunkDescs in the basedir.</LI>

<LI>
The user's User ChunkDesc file, .C2Config/chunkDescs (currently unimplemented).</LI>

<LI>
The Global ConfigChunk file, <TT>C2config</TT> in the basedir.</LI>

<LI>
One of the user's User ConfigChunk files, if one was specified.</LI>
</OL>
The window that CfgEdit opens has two parts. On the left side is a list
of the available panels. Double-click on one of the names on the list to
show that panel in the right side of the window. Currently, there are two
available panels, one for editing ChunkDesc files and one for editing ConfigChunk
files.
<H4>
Editing ConfigChunks</H4>
You can access a list of all ConfigChunks in the DB by double-clicking
on "Chunks" in the Panels list. The list is sorted by type of chunks, so
that all the Display chunks are listed together, and so on.

<P>The Global config file is usually loaded by default. In addition, you
can load a User config file on top of the Global file, so that all the
different Chunks in both files are displayed in the list.

<P>Once you have modified one or more Chunks, there are several options
for saving your work. Using the "Save Global Config" menu option writes
the entire contents to the file C2config in the directory given by basedir.
Of course, you may not have permission to write that file, so there is
also a "Save Global Config As" option which lets you enter a filename.

<P>You can also save just those Chunks which differ from the Global config
file. You do this with the "Save User Config" and "Save User Config As"
menu items, or with the "Save" button to the right of the list of Chunks.
User config files are always written to the user's .C2Config directory,
and always have the suffix ".cfg" added to them.

<P>Once you've loaded the config files you want to deal with, you can look
at and edit the configuration. There are several buttons to the right of
the list of Chunks which help you do this:
<UL>
<LI>
Insert - inserts a new ConfigChunk. The menu button to the right of the
Insert button lets you choose the type of ConfigChunk that will be inserted.</LI>

<LI>
Remove - you can remove a ConfigChunk by selecting it from the list and
then pressing this button.</LI>

<LI>
Clear - removes all ConfigChunks.</LI>

<LI>
Load - does the same thing as the "Load User Config" menu option.</LI>

<LI>
Save - does the same thing as the "Save User Config" menu option.</LI>
</UL>
Double-clicking on a Chunk's name in the list will bring up a new window,
displaying the Chunk's name and a list of all its properties. A text field
at the top of the window lets the user change the Chunk's name.

<P>A scrolling list in the middle of the window displays all of the available
properties. Each property is listed with its name, type, and values. A
line of help information is also displayed if available. The user can edit
the displayed values. If the property is of boolean type, or has a list
of acceptable values, the value is displayed with a pop-up list, from which
the user can choose a new value. Otherwise, the current value is displayed
in a text field, in which the user can enter a new numeric or string value.

<P>Press the OK button to close the window and save any changes. Press
Cancel or the close button to get rid of the window without making any
changes. Of course, nothing happens to the files on disk until you specifically
save them.
<H4>
Editing Chunk Descriptions</H4>
You can edit the list of Chunk descriptions by double-clicking on "Descriptions"
in the Panels list. The panel that shows up looks and functions very similarly
to the ConfigChunk panel; it has the same buttons which perform the same
functions, and an analogous set of menu items. The key difference is that
while there can be multiple User ConfigChunk files in the .C2Config directory,
there is only one ChunkDesc file - .C2Config/chunkDescs .

<P>The Window for editing a ChunkDesc is much like the window for editing
a ConfigChunk. The main difference is the addition of "Insert" and "Remove"
buttons to add and get rid of individual property descriptions.

<P>The ConfigChunk Window had a scrolled list of Properties; the ChunkDesc
Window has a scrolled list of Property descriptions. Each property description
has several fields. The first two are for "Name" and "Token". "Name" is
the string the library or an application will use to access that property.
"Token" is the string that will be used inside the config file. Most likely
you'll want these to be the same, but they don't have to be. The major
limitation is that you may not use white space characters int the Token
field.

<P>Next there is a field to enter the number of values you want this property
to have, and a checkbox to select if you want the property to have a variable
number of values. There is also a text field to enter a help message describing
what the values for this property mean.

<P>Finally, there is a pulldown list to select the type of this property
(String, Integer, Float, Boolean, or Chunk), and a button marked&nbsp;

Known Bugs</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
If you create or load a ChunkDesc for a type "foo", and create a ConfigChunk
of that type, and then edit the ChunkDesc for "foo", the effect on the
extant ConfigChunks is not defined. They <I>ought</I> to cleanly adapt
to the new ChunkDesc. What will currently probably <I>happen</I> is that
the Chunk will retain the old description, save itself according to that
description, and cause a parse error when it's reloaded.</LI>


<P>Reccommended fix: delete all chunks of type "foo" before changing the
description. In practice, ChunkDescs aren't edited often.
<LI>
There should be a way for users to define their own ChunkDescs in a file
in their own directory (much like the Global/User config files). Currently,
if a user wants to add a new type of ConfigChunk for an application they
are creating, the ChunkDesc must be added to the global ChunkDesc file.</LI>

<LI>
While CfgEdit lets you create value lists for float type Properties, the
Config system in VRLib itself doesn't support these correctly yet.</LI>
