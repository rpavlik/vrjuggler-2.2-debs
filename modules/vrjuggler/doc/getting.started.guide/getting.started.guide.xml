      <title>Installing VR Juggler</title>

      <para>As with most Open Source projects, VR Juggler is distributed as
      compressed archive files using popular formats. Installing a
      distribution requires very little effort, but you do need to know how to
      use archiving utilities to extract the installation tree. Automation of
      the installation is a goal of the VR Juggler team, but we are still
      finalizing the details of cross-platform installation management. Before
      reading further, you should know where you want to install VR Juggler,
      and you should make sure that you have access to write to that
      directory.</para>

      <section>
         <title>Installing from a Compressed TAR File</title>

         <para>The TAR (Tape ARchive) format has been around for a long, long
         time in the UNIX world. It is simply a collection of files in a
         directory tree that are lumped into a single file suitable for
         writing to a tape or for downloading. The format is a standard, and
         the <command>tar</command>(1) utility is available on every
         UNIX-based platform and on Win32. A free version can be downloaded
         from <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/">the GNU Project</ulink>. A
         compressed TAR file is made for each VR Juggler distribution, and
         some distributions come in other formats as well. You can always
         count on the availability of a TAR file, though. The TAR files are
         compressed using either GZIP or BZIP2, both of which are standard
         compression formats. The <command>gzip</command>(1) utility is freely
         available from the GNU Project, and the <command>bzip2</command>(1)
         utility can be downloaded for free from <ulink
         url="http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/">RedHat, Inc.</ulink>. The GNU
         version of TAR has the GZIP and BZIP2 algorithms built in. The
         compression algorithm used can be determined by the file extension.
         Files compressed with GZIP end in <filename>.gz</filename>; files
         compressed with BZIP2 end in <filename>.bz2</filename>.</para>

         <para>Once you have downloaded a VR Juggler TAR distribution, you can
         unpack it one of two ways depending on what your platform's version
         of TAR supports. Before extracting the installation tree, make sure
         that your current directory is the one where you want to install VR
         Juggler. If your version of TAR does not have GZIP built in (it does
         not support the <option>-z</option> option), the following command
         will do the decompression and extraction:</para>

         <screen>% gzip -cd vrjuggler-distribution.tar.gz | tar -xvf -</screen>

         <para>For versions of TAR without built-in BZIP2 support (there is no
         <option>-j</option> option) the command is similar:</para>

         <screen>% bzip2 -cd vrjuggler-distribution.tar.bz2 | tar -xvf -</screen>

         <para>Here, you should fill in
         <filename>vrjuggler-distribution.tar.gz</filename> (or
         <filename>vrjuggler-distribution.tar.bz2</filename>) with the name of
         the VR Juggler distribution file you downloaded. The above commands
         will work with any shell that supports redirection of standard output
         to a pipe. If that looks too scary, you can separate the
         decompression and extraction into two commands (for GZIP):</para>

         <screen>% gunzip vrjuggler-distribution.tar.gz
% tar -xvf vrjuggler-distribution.tar</screen>

         <para>or for BZIP2:</para>

         <screen>% bunzip2 vrjuggler-distribution.tar.bz2
% tar -xvf vrjuggler-distribution.tar</screen>

         <para>Note that the distribution file in the second command does not
         have the <filename>.gz</filename> extension after
         <command>gzip</command>(1) is run. These steps also work if your
         version of <command>tar</command>(1) supports the <option>-z</option>
         option (<option>-j</option> for BZIP2), but you can simplify your
         work if that option is supported. The following illustrates how to
         decompress and extract a TAR file compressed with GZIP all in one
         step:</para>

         <screen>% tar -xzvf vrjuggler-distribution.tar.gz</screen>

         <para>The following would be used for a TAR file compressed with
         BZIP2:</para>

         <screen>% tar -xjvf vrjuggler-distribution.tar.bz2</screen>

         <para>In either case, while the command runs, you will see the name
         of each file as it is written to disk. This is because of the
         <option>-v</option> option to <command>tar</command>(1) that tells it
         to be verbose in its efforts. <command>tar</command>(1) takes care of
         creating all the directories in the installation tree, so you only
         need to have the base directory (for example,
         <filename>/usr/local</filename>) when you start. For more information
         about these utilities, please refer to the <command>tar</command>(1)
         and <command>gzip</command>(1) manual pages.</para>

      <section>
         <title>Installing from a ZIP File (Win32 only)</title>

         <para>On the Win32 family of platforms, the ZIP format rules. In the
         old days, you would use the PKZIP utility to uncompress and extract a
         ZIP file. Nowadays, most people use <ulink
         url="http://www.winzip.com/">WinZip</ulink> or some other comparable
         graphical interface. This documentation covers only the use of WinZip
         when extracting a ZIP file.</para>

         <para>Once you have downloaded the VR Juggler ZIP file, the easiest
         way to extract it is to double-click on its icon in the open folder
         window as shown in <xref
         linkend="figure.windows.temp.folder.view" />.</para>

         <title>Installing from a Disk Image (Mac OS X only)</title>

         <para>The preferred Internet distribution format for Mac OS X is the
         disk image (file extension <filename>.dmg</filename>).
         Double-clicking on the <filename>.dmg</filename> file mounts the disk
         image which can then be opened. Pre-compiled versions of VR Juggler
         for Mac OS X are distributed in this manner. Within the mounted disk
         image, there is an installer program for the VR Juggler release (file
         extension <filename>.pkg</filename>)<footnote>
               <para>Unfortunately, the complexity of VR Juggler prevents it
               from being installed using the preferred drag-and-drop
               method.</para>
            </footnote>.</para>

         <important>
            <para>Before installing, read any HTML files included with the VR
            Juggler distribution. These will contain relevant information
            about updating an existing VR Juggler installation or how to use
            the VR Juggler installer that is not covered here.</para>
         </important>

         <para>Double-clicking on the VR Juggler installer will install VR
         Juggler. The VR Juggler libraries will be installed to
         <filename>/usr/local</filename>, and the dependencies will be
         installed to <filename>/usr/local/vrjuggler-deps</filename>. The
         application bundles for the Tweek Java GUI and
         <application>VRJConfig</application> will be installed to
         <filename>/Applications</filename>. Finally, the file
         <filename>~/.MacOSX/environment.plist</filename> will be updated to
         set the VR Juggler-related environment variables (see <xref
         linkend="chapter.envvar" />).</para>

         <note>
            <para>The application bundles for the Tweek Java GUI and
            <application>VRJConfig</application> are still in the early stages
            of development. For convenience, the command line versions of
            these applications are also installed. Running
            <command>tweek</command> or <command>vrjconfig</command> from a
            terminal window will start those applications just as would be
            done on other operating systems. At some point, the command line
            verrsions of these applications will probably be removed on Mac OS
            X in favor of exclusive use of the application bundles.</para>

   <chapter id="chapter.envvar">
      <title>Environment Variables</title>

      <para>There are several <firstterm>environment variables</firstterm>
      that affect the way VR Juggler works. Some of these are required to
      compile and run applications while others are optional. This chapter
      lists all such variables and explains their meanings and uses.</para>

      <section>
         <title>How to Set Environment Variables</title>

         <para>The syntax for setting or changing an environment variable
         varies with operating systems and shell interpreters. Instead of
         choosing one style of syntax that is specific to a particular shell
         type, we define our own syntax which you must then translate to your
         shell's specific syntax. Before defining this syntax, we present the
         method used to set environment variables in the three most common
         types of shells. We also provide a quick overview of how to set
         environment variables using Win32-based GUIs.</para>

         <section>
            <title>Common Conventions and Background</title>

            <para>A convention used throughout this book is to name the
            variables using all capital letters. In almost all cases,
            regardless of the shell, this is the naming convention used for
            environment variables.</para>

            <para>Setting a path with an environment variable can require
            special syntax. Because of this, the method for doing so may vary
            from shell to shell. Paths are important with VR Juggler when
            looking up the path to a shared library (dynamically linked
            library). For each shell, the syntax for setting a path is
            given.</para>

            <para>Referring to environment variables can also vary from shell
            to shell. An example of how to print the value of an environment
            variable will be given for each shell. An example of how to refer
            to an environment variable is also provided as these two
            operations may vary even within one kind of shell!</para>

            <para>In all shells, an environment variable is only available
            within that single shell instance. That is, setting an environment
            variable at a command prompt only affects that specific shell and
            will not be available from other concurrent or future shells. To
            make a setting <quote>permanent</quote>, it should be done in file
            read by all shell instances when they are started. This is
            addressed briefly as appropriate for each shell type.</para>
         </section>

         <section id="section.envvar.csh">
            <title>C-Style Shells (csh, tcsh)</title>

            <para>In a C-style shell (i.e., one whose interface is based on
            the C programming language), setting environment variables is done
            using the built-in command <command>setenv</command>. It is used
            as follows:</para>

            <screen>% setenv &lt;VARIABLE_NAME&gt; &lt;value&gt;</screen>

            <para>where the string <literal>&lt;VARIABLE_NAME&gt;</literal>
            represents the name of the variable you are going to set and
            <literal>&lt;value&gt;</literal> represents the value assigned to
            that variable. Both are required. If the named variable did not
            exist before, it will pop into existence. Otherwise, you overwrite
            the old setting with the new one.</para>

            <para>To print the value of an environment variable, use the
            following command:</para>

            <screen>% printenv &lt;VARIABLE_NAME&gt;</screen>

            <para>Referring to a variable, however, is done using the
            following syntax:</para>

            <screen>% cd $VARIABLE_NAME/bin</screen>

            <para>Paths are specified as a colon-separated list. An example of
            this is:</para>

            <screen>% printenv PATH
/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin</screen>

            <para>For these types of shells, a <quote>permanent</quote>
            setting for a given variable should usually be done in your .cshrc
            file or in your <filename>.login</filename> file, both of which
            should be in your home directory. In most cases, it is better to
            use <filename>.cshrc</filename> because it is evaluated for every
            shell instance.</para>

         <section id="section.envvar.sh">
            <title>sh-Derived Shells (sh, ksh, bash, zsh, etc.)</title>

            <para>In a shell based on sh, setting environment variables is
            done using the built-in command <command>export</command>. It is
            used as follows:</para>

            <screen>% export &lt;VARIABLE_NAME&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</screen>

            <para>or</para>

            <screen>% &lt;VARIABLE_NAME&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
% export &lt;VARIABLE_NAME&gt;</screen>

            <para>Here, the string <literal>&lt;VARIABLE_NAME&gt;</literal>
            represents the name of the variable you are going to set and
            <literal>&lt;value&gt;</literal> represents the value assigned to
            that variable. Both are required. Note that there is no space
            between the variable name and its value. If the named variable did
            not exist before, it will pop into existence. Otherwise, you
            overwrite the old setting with the new one. If the variable was
            already among your current shell's environment variables, the
            export command is not necessary.</para>

            <para>To print the value of an environment variable, use the
            following command:</para>

            <screen>% echo $VARIABLE_NAME</screen>

            <para>Getting the value of a variable works the same way.</para>

            <para>Paths are specified as a colon-separated list. An example of
            this is:</para>

            <screen>% echo $PATH
/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin</screen>

            <para>For these types of shells, a <quote>permanent</quote>
            setting for a given variable should usually be done in the
            <filename>.profile</filename> file in your home directory or in
            your shell's <quote>rc</quote> file. Different shells have
            different names for this file. Examples are
            <filename>.bashrc</filename> for BASH and
            <filename>.zshrc</filename> for Zsh. Please refer to your shell's
            documentation for more information. In any case, the file will be
            in your home directory.</para>

         <section id="section.envvar.dos">
            <title>DOS Shell</title>

            <para>The typical syntax for setting an environment variable from

            <screen>C:\&gt; set &lt;VARIABLE_NAME&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</screen>

            <para>Here, <literal>&lt;VARIABLE_NAME&gt;</literal> is the name
            of the environment variable to be set, and
            <literal>&lt;value&gt;</literal> is the value being assigned to
            that variable. If the named variable did not exist before, it will
            pop into existence. Otherwise, you overwrite the old setting with
            the new one.</para>

                  application. It should be set to the base directory of the
                  installed VR Juggler library. For example, if you downloaded
                  a UNIX version of VR Juggler 2.0 and extracted it to the

                  only the N32 and 64 formats, and there are different library

                  <envar>JCCL_DEFINITION_PATH</envar> appends directories to
                  the default search path. It is not possible to change the

                     <para>Python programmers will find this sort of behavior
                     familiar. This functionality is based on the way that the
                     Python environment variables <envar>PYTHONHOME</envar>
                     and <envar>PYTHONPATH</envar> behave. In this case,
                     <envar>PYTHONHOME</envar> corresponds to
                     <envar>VJ_BASE_DIR</envar>, and <envar>PYTHONPATH</envar>
                     corresponds with <envar>JCCL_DEFINITION_PATH</envar>.
                     Indeed, the behavior of
                     <envar>JCCL_DEFINITION_PATH</envar> was inspired by the
                     handling of <envar>PYTHONPATH</envar> by the Python

                  <para>This variable can be used to control the amount of
                  diagnostic information a VR Juggler application outputs. Its
                  value is a number between 0 (only very important messages
                  are printed) and 7 (vast amounts of data) inclusive.
                  Non-hackers are advised to use levels 0 through 3, as higher

      <title>VR Juggler Sample Applications</title>

      <para>VR Juggler comes with several sample applications in its
      <filename>samples</filename> directory tree. Many of them are very
      simple and are designed to demonstrate a specific feature of VR Juggler
      or a technique to use when writing your own applications. This chapter
      lists the current sample applications as of this writing and gives a
      quick description of what you as a potential developer might find
      interesting in the code. Those users who just want to run applications
      can safely skip this chapter.</para>

      <section>
         <title>Tutorial Applications</title>

         <para>Some sample applications designed for getting started with VR
         Juggler are found in
         <filename>$VJ_BASE_DIR/share/vrjuggler/samples/OGL/simple</filename>.
         All of these applications were designed to be used as part of courses
         teaching people how to write VR Juggler applications using OpenGL.
         They contain clear comments explaining what the code is doing, and
         they are intended to be as simple as possible. These tutorials are as
         follows:</para>

         <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
               <para>simpleInput: An application that demonstrates how to get
               input from devices. No graphics are rendered with this
               application. It is intended to be a starting point for getting
               an understanding of how user input is queried.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
               <para>SimpleApp: A very simple OpenGL application that draws a
               small cube in space and draws the coordinate axes for the
               cube.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
               <para>contextApp: An application demonstrating how to use
               OpenGL display lists in VR Juggler applications. This extends
               SimpleApp by using a display list to draw a cube and by moving
               the cube with the wand.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
               <para>ConfigApp: A relatively simple application that
               demonstrates how user-level code can take advantage of the VR
               Juggler configuration system, JCCL.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
               <para>MPApp: A more complex OpenGL application that
               demonstrates how to do multi-processing in VR Juggler
               applications. As it exists in its distributed form, no
               multi-processing is done. A more detailed lesson is available
               that explains how to extend the application to employ
               multi-processing techniques.</para>
            </listitem>
         </itemizedlist>

         <para>For a step-by-step lesson how to use these applications to
         learn VR Juggler application programming, please refer to the
         <emphasis>Programmer's Guide</emphasis>. It contains sections
         explaining each of the above applications in great detail. Each
         lesson ends with an exercise where the reader extends the application
         to include some new functionality.</para>

         <title>Advanced OpenGL Performer Applications</title>

         <para>Examples of OpenGL Performer applications can be found in

         These are for more advanced developers who are familiar with
         Performer and some of the more complicated aspects of VR Juggler.
         There are two main programs to be found there:</para>

               <para>pfNav: A starting point for basic VR Juggler Performer
               applications that need to load a model and navigate through it.
               Users implement their application by inheriting from a provided
               class, <classname>simplePfNav</classname>. This may be a good
               place for intermediate-level users of OpenGL Performer to start
               because <classname>simplePfNav</classname> hides many of the
               complicated details (which actually makes that class far from

      <title>Compiling a VR Juggler Sample Program</title>

      <para>Now that you have VR Juggler installed and you have your
      environment all configured, it is time for the fun to begin. No,
      seriously. You are now ready to compile and run VR Juggler applications,
      and that is the whole point, right? This chapter explains how to compile
      the applications provided in the directory
      <filename>$VJ_BASE_DIR/share/vrjuggler/samples/OGL/simple</filename>.</para>

      <section>
         <title>Required Reading</title>

         <para>Before reading any further, make sure you have already read the
         instructions on how to install VR Juggler (in <xref
         linkend="chapter.vrj.install" />) and on how to configure your
         environment (in <xref linkend="chapter.envvar" />). That information
         will not be repeated, and it is assumed that you already know what we
         mean by <envar>VJ_BASE_DIR</envar>. You should also have a basic
         understanding of how <command>make</command>(1) works, but in these
         examples, nothing more will be necessary than typing
         <literal>make</literal> on the command line. Refer to the
         <command>make</command>(1) manual page for more information about
         it.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
         <title>Compiling an Application</title>

         <para>There are two ways to compile VR Juggler applications: from the
         command line or with Microsoft Visual Studio. Compiling an
         application on the command line requires the use of GNU make (often
         installed as <command>gmake</command>) so that it will work on all
         supported platforms including Win32. Using Microsoft Visual Studio
         will only work on Win32.</para>

         <section>
            <title>Compiling from the Command Line</title>

            <para>All the sample programs in
            <filename>$VJ_BASE_DIR/share/vrjuggler/samples</filename> use the
            same basic steps to compile unless otherwise noted. Always refer
            to the top of the sample application's
            <filename>Makefile</filename> for information that may be specific
            to building that application. In general, though, all
            applications' makefiles require the GNU version of the
            <command>make</command>(1) utility, sometimes installed as
            <command>gmake</command>.</para>

            <para>The example used here will be the MPApp tutorial application
            found in
            <filename>$VJ_BASE_DIR/share/vrjuggler/samples/OGL/simple/MPApp</filename>.
            It is an OpenGL-based application that will compile and run on all
            platforms supported by VR Juggler. Begin by changing into the
            directory
            <filename>$VJ_BASE_DIR/share/vrjuggler/samples/OGL/simple/MPApp</filename>
            in a command shell.</para>

            <para>To compile MPApp, simply enter the following:</para>

            <screen>% gmake</screen>

            <para>The compile process will then begin. As noted above, the use
            of GNU make is required to use the distributed makefiles. With
            Cygwin, GNU make is simply <command>make</command>. If you have
            your system set up properly, it will complete with an executable
            <filename>MPApp</filename> file (or <filename>MPApp.exe</filename>
            on Win32) in the directory. Now that you have a program compiled,
            it is time to learn how to run it. (Readers who are not using
            Visual Studio can skip ahead to <xref
            linkend="chapter.app.running" />.)</para>
         </section>

         <section>
            <title>Compiling Using Microsoft Visual Studio</title>

            <note>
               <para>Remember that the Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) is
               <emphasis>required</emphasis> to use VR Juggler on Windows. Its
               DLL directory must be in your path (via the <envar>PATH</envar>
               environment variable) for proper application execution. The
               NSPR can be downloaded from the <ulink
               url="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/nspr">NSPR home
               page</ulink>. If the pre-compiled VR Juggler dependencies are
               installed, then NSPR is already available.</para>
            </note>

            <para>All OpenGL sample applications are shipped with
            pre-configured Microsoft Visual C++ projects. This is done to help
            new users get started with compiling VR Juggler applications and
            to give experienced Visual Studio users a starting place for their
            application development. To use the workspace for the MPApp
            application, begin by opening the folder containing the source
            code and double-clicking on

      <title>Running a VR Juggler Sample Program</title>

      <para>It is important to note that the same VR Juggler application can
      be run in simulator mode or in a full-scale VR system with no
      modifications. What does change is the configuration files used when
      starting the program. In
      <filename>$VJ_BASE_DIR/share/vrjuggler/data/configFiles</filename>, you
      can find many basic configuration files including those for running in
      simulator using a mouse and keyboard to simulate VR input devices and
      some example files based on those used for the VRAC C4 system. In the
      directory, you will see some files with names containing
      <quote>mixin</quote>. These are special files that provide a specific
      capability not necessarily needed by all applications. They can be mixed
      in (hence the name) with other configuration files as needed. The
      configuration files found in the <filename>configFiles</filename>
      directory will be referenced in the examples provided, so be sure you
      know where they are.</para>

         <title>Required Reading</title>

         <para>Before reading any further, make sure you have already read the
         instructions on how to install VR Juggler (see <xref
         linkend="chapter.vrj.install" />) and on how to configure your
         environment (see <xref linkend="chapter.envvar" />). That information
         will not be repeated, and it is assumed that you already know what we
         mean by <envar>VJ_BASE_DIR</envar> and
         <envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</envar>, to name two environment variables. At
         this point, it is also assumed that you already have compiled an
         application (MPApp in the case of the examples provided), so you
         should be sure to have read about how to compile a sample VR Juggler

         <title>Running an Application with a Simulator Configuration</title>

         <para>Running in <quote>simulator mode</quote> means that your input
         is simulated and your display windows may have limited functionality.
         (By <quote>simulated input</quote>, we mean that input is provided
         through windows that take keyboard and mouse input and translate that
         into transformations in the virtual world.) Simulator viewports are
         limited primarily in that they cannot display stereo graphics. It is
         important to note that a simulator viewport is a special kind of VR
         Juggler viewport within a display window. Instead of basing its
         viewpoint on the head position of one of the users, the viewpoint is
         controlled by a separate camera that is just another positional
         device. Within a simulator viewport, VR Juggler draws certain objects
         to help visualize the environment. For example, the heads of users
         are represented as blue ellipsoids with gray eyes, and a wand (if
         present) is drawn as a green pointing device. Besides these common
         simulator objects, display surfaces can be drawn. These represent
         projection screens or HMD viewing projections and are drawn as
         translucent rectangles.</para>

         <para>As mentioned, several simulator configuration files are
         provided with a VR Juggler distribution. These files provide a
         complete simulation of an immersive environment. Please note that
         this documentation reflects the state of the configuration files at
         the time the documentation was written. For more information about
         the configuration files and how to view or modify the configuration,
         refer to the <emphasis>VRJConfig Guide</emphasis>. (Using VRJConfig
         is the best way to find out how a specific configuration file is set
         up.) The configuration files of interest for simulator mode are as
         follows:</para>

               that are beyond the scope of this particular book. It also
               defines simulated head movement using the keyboard. For now, it
               is sufficient to know that it is required to run the sample
               applications in simulator mode.</para>

               <para>This file also contains the basic simulator display
               configuration file needed by all applications when run in

         <section>
            <title>Starting the Application</title>

            <para>Now it is time to run the applicationâ€”finally! Make sure
            that all your environment variables are set properly before trying
            to start the application. Once you are ready, specify the name of
            the application and all the configuration files it needs. An
            example of this is:</para>

            <screen>% MPApp sim.base.jconf sim.wand.mixin.jconf</screen>

            <para>You will notice that no paths are specified for finding the
            configuration files. The full paths to the configuration files is
            not necessary because the default search path will correctly find
            these files in
            <filename>$VJ_BASE_DIR/share/vrjuggler/data/configFiles</filename>.
            Beginning users will typically want to reference the example
            configuration files in that directory. As you get more comfortable
            with VR Juggler and its configuration system, you may want to make
            your own modified files and put them in the directory
            <filename>$HOME/.vjconfig</filename>. The environment variable
            <envar>VJ_CFG_PATH</envar> is useful in providing a search path
            for finding your configuration files. (Refer to <xref
            linkend="section.envvars.optional" /> for more information on
            using <envar>VJ_CFG_PATH</envar>). To simplify running
            applications, you may want to make a shell script (or batch file
            as appropriate) that does all the work of passing configuration
            files and common command-line arguments.</para>

            <para>As the application starts, you will see a status output
            printed to the console (more or less depending on how you have
            <envar>VPR_DEBUG_NFY_LEVEL</envar>,
            <envar>VPR_DEBUG_ALLOW_CATEGORIES</envar>, and
            <envar>VPR_DEBUG_DISALLOW_CATEGORIES</envar> set), and then one
            moderately sized simulator display window will open on the left
            side of your screen while three blank keyboard input windows open
            on the right side of your screen. The display window will be
            titled <quote>SimWindow1</quote>, and the keyboard input windows
            will be titled <quote>Head Keyboard</quote>, <quote>Sim View
            Cameras Control</quote> and <quote>Wand Keyboard</quote> (in order
            from the top of the display to the bottom). Do not worry that the
            keyboard windows are blackâ€”that is normal. The display window will
            have an animated blue mesh, a cyan ellipsoid, and a green pointer.
            The mesh is what you have come to see; the ellipsoid is the user's
            head; and the pointer is the user's hand. In <xref
            linkend="figure.MPApp.running" />, we show what this looks on a
            RedHat Linux 7.2 desktop for comparison with what you are seeing.
            Note that the head and wand are only rendered in the simulator
            windows. They are present because head and wand input are being
            simulated, and it is typically quite helpful to see the results of
            that simulated input. To exit the application, press
            <keysym>ESC</keysym> in the window titled <quote>Head
            Window</quote>.</para>

               variable (or any other environment variable), makefile syntax

               <title>Running an Application on Mac OS X with the X Window
               System</title>

               <para>Running a VR Juggler application on Mac OS X is slightly
               different if VR Juggler was compiled against <ulink
               url="http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/">X11 for OS X</ulink>.
               Before starting the VR Juggler application, X11 must be
               running. This can be accomplished by double-clicking on the X11
               icon in the Applications folder. By default, X11 will open a
               standard xterm when it starts. In this xterm, the
               <envar>$DISPLAY</envar> environment variable will be set
               correctly, and it is recommended that VR Juggler applications
               be launched from this xterm. From this xterm, set the necessary
               environment variables as described earlier in <xref
               linkend="section.envvars.required" />. Once this is done, the
               application can be executed from the command line just as
               described in the previous section.</para>

               <para>MPApp is shown executing on a Mac OS X desktop in <xref
               linkend="figure.MPApp.running.single.OSX" />. Note that in the
               dock, the X11 icon is activated and that the application menu
               is for an X11 application. This truly is an X11 application
               running on OS X.</para>

            <title>Basic Desktop Configuration Controls</title>

            <para>So now you are probably wondering what you can do with this
            fancy application. Both of the preceding configurations use the
            same keyboard/mouse mappings; they vary only in which windows
            accept the keyboard and mouse input. Using the multi-window
            configuration, head movement is done with the keyboard in
            <quote>Head Keyboard</quote>; camera movement is done with the
            keyboard in <quote>Sim View Cameras Control</quote>; and wand
            movement is done with the keyboard and mouse in <quote>Wand
            Keyboard</quote>. Using the single-window configuration, all input
            is done with the keyboard and mouse in <quote>Sim Window</quote>.
            Note, however, that for the single-window configuration, the
            camera is attached to the user's head for an over-the-shoulder
            view, and hence, it does not move separately from the head. For
            information on how to verify these settings and to view the
            current configuration, refer to the <emphasis>VRJConfig
            Guide</emphasis>. The following list of tables provides all the
            keyboard and mouse controls for the simulator when using these
            particular configuration files. Note that it is possible to
            reconfigure the simulator to suit your preferences. This is
            provided mainly for those who just want something that works
            now.</para>

            <para>Before continuing on to running an application in a
            full-scale VR system, we provide two asides: using a simulated
            glove and using a simulated analog device. The examples provided
            thus far have not discussed this because the information was not
            relevant to the particular sample application being used. Knowing
            how to use these simulated devices is important, however, and it
            is treated separately as a reference for your future endeavors in
            running VR Juggler applications.</para>

            <para>If you include the
            <filename>sim.glove.mixin.jconf</filename> file, your application
            will also have access to a simulated glove, with position and
            gesture inputs. The glove is controlled by a window titled
            <quote>Glove Keyboard</quote>. This window lets you control the
            glove position and selected gesture. Movement control of the glove
            uses the mouse and is the same as that of the wand. The mouse
            buttons are used to select gestures. The mapping of the gesture
            numbers to actual hand positions is controlled by the
            <quote>training file</quote> for the sim glove. The default
            training file is

         <title>Running an Application in a VR System</title>

         <para>Running an application full-scale in a VR system is more
         complicated than running in simulator mode. The reason for this is
         that VR systems tend to differ in configuration and in available
         hardware. VR Juggler is flexible enough to handle most any
         configuration you throw at it, but those configurations need to be
         put together first. Examples of configuration files used in VRAC's C4
         system are provided, and they are used in this documentation. It
         should be noted, however, that for any particular system, custom
         configuration files will probably have to be written. The idea behind
         this section is to provide a basic understanding of what is needed to
         get started with running in a VR system.</para>

         <para>The example configuration files in the directory
         <filename>$VJ_BASE_DIR/share/vrjuggler/data/configFiles</filename>
         modeled after those used for VRAC's C4 system are as follows:</para>

               necessary for loading a VR Juggler application in the C4 in its
               closed configuration with full tracking and stereoscopic
               graphics.</para>
            </listitem>

               closed configuration with full tracking and monoscopic
               graphics.</para>

               configuration file needed by all applications when run in the
               C4. It defines commonly used VR Juggler concepts that are
               beyond the scope of this particular book.</para>

            <listitem>
               <para><filename>C4.displays.closed.jconf</filename> - The basic
               display configuration file needed to run with all four walls
               active and rendering stereoscopic graphics. This defines only
               the four surface displays to be opened. The corners are
               configured for the closed position of the moveable
               walls.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
               <para><filename>C4.displays.closed.mono.jconf</filename> - The
               basic display configuration file needed to run with all four
               walls active and rendering monoscopic graphics. This defines
               only the four surface displays to be opened. The corners are
               configured for the closed position of the moveable
               walls.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
               <para><filename>C4.mstar.jconf</filename> - The Ascension
               MotionStar configuration file that defines which bird provides

               frequency wireless mouse that acts as a wand.</para>

         </itemizedlist>

         <para>Running the application is the same as in simulator mode except
         that the configuration files given on the command line are different.
         For example, to run MPApp in the C4 with stereoscopic graphics, the
         following command would be used:</para>

         <para>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
         other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom:
         to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
         with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
         Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a
         way to get credit for their work, while not being considered
         responsible for modifications made by others.</para>

         <para>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that
         derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same
         sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a
         copyleft license designed for free software.</para>

         <para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
         for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
         free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
         that the software does. But this License is not limited to software
         manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject
         matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend
         this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or

         <para id="gfdl-doc">This License applies to any manual or other work,
         in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder
         saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a
         notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in
         duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The
         "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of
         the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the
         license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring
         permission under copyright law.</para>

         <para id="gfdl-mod-ver">A "Modified Version" of the Document means
         any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
         verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
         language.</para>

         <para id="gfdl-secnd-sect">A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix
         or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with
         the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
         Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
         nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus,
         if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary
         Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a
         matter of historical connection with the subject or with related
         matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political
         position regarding them.</para>

         <para id="gfdl-inv-sect">The "Invariant Sections" are certain
         Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of
         Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is
         released under this License. If a section does not fit the above
         definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as
         Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the
         Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are
         none.</para>

         <para id="gfdl-cov-text">The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages
         of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in
         the notice that says that the Document is released under this
         License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover
         Text may be at most 25 words.</para>

         <para id="gfdl-transparent">A "Transparent" copy of the Document

         for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors
         or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for
         drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable
         for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a
         variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made
         in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
         markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
         modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not
         Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that
         is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>

         <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
         plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
         SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
         simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
         Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
         Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
         edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the
         DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
         machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
         processors for output purposes only.</para>

         <para id="gfdl-title-page">The "Title Page" means, for a printed
         book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed
         to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the
         title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as
         such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance
         of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
         text.</para>

         <para id="gfdl-entitled">A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named
         subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or
         contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in
         another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name
         mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
         "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a
         section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section
         "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.</para>

         <para>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the

         <title>COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>

         <para>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
         have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
         the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
         the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
         Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
         the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
         you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present
         the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
         visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
         Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
         the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be
         treated as verbatim copying in other respects.</para>

         <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
         fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
         reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
         pages.</para>

         <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
         numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
         Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
         each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
         network-using public has access to download using public-standard
         network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
         of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take
         reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
         copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain
         thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after
         the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your
         agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.</para>

         <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors
         of the Document well before redistributing any large number of

         <para>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
         appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
         copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or
         all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to
         the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license
         notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section
         titles.</para>

         <para>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it
         contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various

         passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added
         by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document
         already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by
         you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
         behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one,
         on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old

         <para>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this

         <title>COMBINING DOCUMENTS</title>

         <para>You may combine the Document with other documents released
         under this License, under the terms defined in <link
         linkend="gfdl-4">section 4</link> above for modified versions,
         provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant
         Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them
         all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
         notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.</para>

         <para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License,
         and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a
         single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same
         name but different contents, make the title of each such section
         unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
         original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
         unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the
         list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined
         work.</para>

         <para>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
         "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
         Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
         "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must
         delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".</para>
      </section>

      <section id="gfdl-6">
         <title>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</title>

         <para>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
         documents released under this License, and replace the individual
         copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
         that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
         rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
         in all other respects.</para>

         <para>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
         distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
         copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
         License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
         document.</para>

         <title>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</title>

         <para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
         separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
         storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
         copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
         legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
         works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
         License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are
         not themselves derivative works of the Document.</para>

         <para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
         these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
         half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
         placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or
         the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
         form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the
         whole aggregate.</para>

      <section id="gfdl-8">
         <title>TRANSLATION</title>

         <para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
         distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
         Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
         permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
         translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
         original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
         translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
         Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
         include the original English version of this License and the original
         versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement
         between the translation and the original version of this License or a
         notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</para>

         <para>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
         "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
         its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
         title.</para>

         <title>TERMINATION</title>

         <para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
         Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any
         other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document
         is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
         License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from
         you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
         long as such parties remain in full compliance.</para>

         <title>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</title>

         <para>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
         of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new
         versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
         differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See

         <para>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version

         option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified
         version or of any later version that has been published (not as a
         draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not
         specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
