[Version 0.1.97 - 7.19.2000]===================================================
Jul-13-2000 cjust     Environment Manager works under NT
                      Config files can have includes for chunkdesc files
                      Config file includes now use relative paths correctly
                      Vjcontrol fixes for editing embedded chunks
                      Vjcontrol internal event architecture expanded
                      Vjcontrol componentization (partial)

                      code will probably not work on versions of IRIX before
                      6.5 as a result.
                      Added the new utility library Juggler_utils which is
