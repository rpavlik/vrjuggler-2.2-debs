#
# This include file <dpp.clean.mk> handles clean-up operations.  It adds a
# 'clean' target and a 'cleandepend' target.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The Makefiles that include this file can add to the $(CLEAN_FILES) variable
# to dictate which files should be removed when 'make clean' is done.
# Common files that are likely to always be removed should be listed here.
# A $(CLEAN_DIRS) variable is provided for recursively removing directories.
# It is used in the same manner as $(CLEAN_FILES).
#
# To provide a "local" 'clean' target in the file including this code,
# define $(_LOCAL_CLEAN) before including this file and define a target
# called '_clean'.  It will be run after the standard 'clean' target is
# executed.
#
# Example:
#     CLEAN_FILES += file1.o file2.o
#
# Similarly, a "local" 'cleandepend' target can be used by defining
# $(_LOCAL_CLEANDEP) before including this file.  The name of the local
# target is '_cleandepend', and it will be run after the standard
# 'cleandepend' target is finished.
