#
# This include file <dpp.install.mk> handles install operations.  It adds an
# 'install' target.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The Makefile including this file must define the following variables:
#
# includedir - The installation directory for the header files.  This is
#              only needed if the default value for $(INSTALL_PATH) is to be
#              used.
# srcdir     - The directory where the source file(s) is/are located.  This is
#              only needed if the default value for $(INSTALL_FILES) is to be
#              used.
# INSTALL    - The path to a BSD-compatible install program.
#
# Optionally, the including file can add to the following existing variables
# to provide additional local 'install':
#
# INSTALL_DEPS   - Dependencies for the 'install' target.
# INSTALL_FILES  - The file(s) to be installed.
# INSTALL_PATH   - The path to which the file(s) will be installed.
# FILE_PERMS     - Permissions on normal (non-executable) files.
# GROUP_NAME     - The name of the group that will own the files.  If this is
#                  not defined, no attempt is made to set an alternate group
#                  name.
# SUBDIR         - The list of subdirectories where installation needs to be
#                  done.
# INSTALL_SUBDIR - The list of subdirectories where installation *alone* needs
#                  to be done.  This can be used in conjunction with $(SUBDIR)
#                  to list directories where no compiling will be done.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The target defined here is as follows:
#
#     install - Recurse over any subdirectories in $(SUBDIR) running 'install'
#               in each and then install $(INSTALL_FILES) in the current
#               directory.
