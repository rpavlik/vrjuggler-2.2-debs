1. In what order should I include .mk files?

   If a .mk file sets values for variables without defining any targets,
   it should be included at the top of a Makefile.  If a .mk file
   performs actions based on the value of variables, it should be included
   at the end of a Makefile.

2. When installing with dpp.libs.mk or dpp.libs-basic.mk, what is the
   difference between "beforeisntall" and "preinstall"?

   In dpp.libs.mk, there are concepts of a "full installation" and a
   "specific installation".  A full installation is one that installs
   everything including headers, static and dynamic libraries, extra
   files, etc.  When doing a full installation, "beforeinstall" and
   "afterinstall" would be done.  A specific installation only installs
   a subset of a full installation.  For example, it would install only
   static debugging libraries.  In a specific installation, "preinstall"
   and "postinstall" are run.  Note that "preinstall" and "postinstall"
   may be run by the full installation since a full installation
   encompasses multiple specific installations.
