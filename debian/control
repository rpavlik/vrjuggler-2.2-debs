Description: VR Juggler 2.2 Suite metapackage - VR Virtual Platform
 VR Juggler provides virtual reality (VR) software developers with a suite of
 application programming interfaces (APIs) that abstract, and hence simplify,
 all interface aspects of their program including the display surfaces, object
 tracking, selection and navigation, graphics rendering engines, and graphical
 user interfaces. An application written with VR Juggler is essentially
 independent of device, computer platform, and VR system. VR Juggler may be run
 with any combination of immersive technologies and computational hardware.
 .
 Install this package to install all libraries needed to run VR Juggler-based
 applications that have already been compiled.
