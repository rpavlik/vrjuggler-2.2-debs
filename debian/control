Package: vrjuggler-2.2
Architecture: any
Section: libs
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: VR Juggler 2.2 Suite metapackage - VR Virtual Platform
 VR Juggler provides virtual reality (VR) software developers with a suite of
 application programming interfaces (APIs) that abstract, and hence simplify,
 all interface aspects of their program including the display surfaces, object
 tracking, selection and navigation, graphics rendering engines, and graphical
 user interfaces. An application written with VR Juggler is essentially
 independent of device, computer platform, and VR system. VR Juggler may be run
 with any combination of immersive technologies and computational hardware.

Package: libtweek-1.2
Section: libs
Priority: optional
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Tweek API for distributed applications for VR Juggler 2.2.x
 The Tweek API provides a wrapper around CORBA for writing applications
 based on the distributed model/view/controller system. In the scope of
 VR Juggler, such applications are usually immersive worlds that have a
 GUI that communicates with the immersive application through a network
 connection.
