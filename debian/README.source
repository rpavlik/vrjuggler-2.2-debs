This package's original source was created by loading the
VR Juggler upstream SVN using git-svn, in the 2.2 release branch.

You can view a web version of the repository here, to verify this:

Note that the entire vrjuggler.org web site is inaccessible to
Iowa State University users whose systems are located behind the NAT
(option chosen during NetReg, can be changed using ASW).  This is a
problem at Priority 5 (the current commercial entity behind VR Juggler)
and has been reported to them - you might try reminding them in hopes of
solving this bothersome problem.
